######################################################What is Python?############################################################
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:

web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.

##########################################################Python Indentation#######################################################
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.


#######################################################Variables###########################################################
Variables are containers for storing data values.

#####Creating Variables
Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it

##########Casting
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

Example
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

################Get the Type
You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

Example
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))


###########################Python - Variable Names
####Camel Case
Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

myVariableName = "John"

########Pascal Case
Each word starts with a capital letter:

MyVariableName = "John"

#########Snake Case
Each word is separated by an underscore character:

my_variable_name = "John"


#########Python Variables - Assign Multiple Values

######Many Values to Multiple Variables
Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:

ExampleGet your own Python Server
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)


########One Value to Multiple Variables
And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:

Example
x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

########Unpack a Collection
If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.

Example
Unpack a list:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

###########Python - Output Variables
In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:

Example
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:

Example
x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)

The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types:

Example
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x, y)

###################Python Numbers
There are three numeric types in Python:

int
float
complex

Example 
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

#########Type Conversion
You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods:

Example
Convert from one type to another:

x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

#convert from int to float:
a = float(x)

#convert from float to int:
b = int(y)

#convert from int to complex:
c = complex(x)

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
Note: You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.

#######################Random Number
Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:

Example
Import the random module, and display a random number between 1 and 9:

import random

print(random.randrange(1, 10))

#################Strings
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

'hello' is the same as "hello".

#####################Quotes Inside Quotes
You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:

Example
print("It's alright")
print("He is called 'Johnny'")
print('He is called "Johnny"')


#########################Multiline Strings
You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:

Example
You can use three double quotes:

a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)


##############################Strings are Arrays
Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.

However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.

Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.

Example
Get the character at position 1 (remember that the first character has the position 0):

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[1])


############################String Length
To get the length of a string, use the len() function.

Example
The len() function returns the length of a string:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(len(a))

#######################Check String
To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in.

Example
Check if "free" is present in the following text:

txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("free" in txt)
